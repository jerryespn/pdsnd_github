### Credits

I would like to thank to my mentor and master Ian Garc√≠a for be patient and put me on the way of Udacity training.

It would not have been possible for me to take this course without [Axity's](https://www.axity.com/es/) support, so I would also like to thank the Information Management area for supporting me and the Architects team.
