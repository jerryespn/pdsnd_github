### Credits

I would like to thank to my mentor and master Ian García for be patient and put me on the way of Udacity training.

It would not have been possible for me to take this course without [**Axity's**](https://www.axity.com/es/) support, so I would also like to thank the Information Management area for supporting me and the Architects team.
